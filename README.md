# Robust-Permutation-Test

The methodology was derived by Chung and Romano 2013 http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aos/1366138199

K-sample permutation tests have been long discussed to test some key statistics like mean for different groups. 

However, wrong inferences can occur when underlying distribution assumption doesn’t hold since it can lead to a failure in constructing an α level test ( Chung and Romano, 2013).

The paper Exact and asymptotically robust permutation tests by Eunyi Chung and Joseph P.Romano studies the asymptotic behavior of permutation distribution for general test statistic when underlying distributions of k-samples differ.
